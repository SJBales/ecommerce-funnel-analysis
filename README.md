# Business Problem

Problem: Customer conversion across the ecommerce site has been identified as a potential area of improvement.

Analysis Objectives:
 1. Assess customer conversion through key steps of the funnel
 2. Analyze and identify differences in conversion across customer segments and cohorts
 3. Investigate trends in user conversion over time

Business Objective: identify steps in the ecommerce funnel for the product teams to focus on to increase conversion, and highlight any key user segments to focus on for potential product optimization or marketing campaigns.

# Analysis Plan (To be deleted later)

## Planned Analyses
High-level understanding of customer conversion:
 1. Aggregate conversion rate across all customers and time
 2. Conversion rates over time (daily trends) + time based cohort analysis
 3. Conversion rates for geographic segments
 4. Conversion rates for device segments
 5. Session conversion. Key questions:
    a. How often do customers convert in the first session?
    b. How quickly do customers convert in a given session?
    c. How long does each step typically take?
    d. Does the length of a session affect conversion rates?

## Next Steps
- Need to test data quality of junk sessions (i.e. that lasted very short time, likely less than 5 seconds)
- Plan the structure of the pipeline (scripts, classes, outputs, etc.)
