    "- A really small fraction (~5%) of customers convert from viewing the page to adding items to cart\n",
    "- The most dramatic drop in conversion happens from beginning checkout to completing a purchase (over 50% reduction in the conversion rate). This is extremely high, and I suggest examining the checkout process. Possible causes:\n",
    "    - There may be too many steps in the process and customers get frustrated and give up\n",
    "    - There may be a bug with required information, etc. that make users second guess the purchase\n",
    "    - There could be nothing wrong with the interface, but unexpected charges are being applied (i.e. shipping, cannot use code, cannot apply a sale) that is turning customers away"
